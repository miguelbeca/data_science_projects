This is the repository for my Capston Project 2 related to Gold Return Prediction.

The files are numbered according to the section in which the relevant output appears in the report, with the exception of the Machine Learning
section which has files numbered 5a through 8c, and Neural Networks, which appears in Section 7 of the report.

All the required datasets are in the 'data' folder.
